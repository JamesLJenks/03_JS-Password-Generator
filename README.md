# 03_JS-Password-Generator
## Description

The goal of this project was to modify starter code to create an application that would run in the web browser and enable hypothetical employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they select. The 

The list of password criteria to be specified included the length, as well as lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters. All selections are facilitated using a series of browser window prompts. Once the user specifies all criteria, the JavaScript code generates a randomized password.

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```
